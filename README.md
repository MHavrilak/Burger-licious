# Burger-licious
A burger logger app with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a ORM

In this assignment we were to follow the MVC design pattern to design a burger logger using MySQL, NOde, Express, Handlebars and an ORM.

The HTML was rendered using handlebars. Database holding the burger types and toppings were set up with MySQL and I used an ORM to sort them and post them.

Used Node Express to navigate the backend in designing the burger.
